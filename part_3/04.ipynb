    "### Breaking Down the Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bond Events**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 209  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 98  \n",
    "- This represents how often nucleotides form bonds. Bonding occurs more than twice as often in normal gravity, likely due to increased particle interactions from gravitational pull.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 200  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 200  \n",
    "- The population remains constant across both conditions, meaning differences in bonding are not due to particle loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Resources**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 720.93  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 508.05  \n",
    "- Resources are about 42% higher in normal gravity. Gravity may concentrate resources into certain areas, facilitating bonding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Mass**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 0.96  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 0.96  \n",
    "- There is no difference in particle mass, indicating that gravityâ€™s effect on bonding is independent of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average Chain Length**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 8.27  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 4.06  \n",
    "- Chains formed in normal gravity are, on average, twice as long as those in microgravity, indicating a greater tendency for molecular complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Chain Length**  \n",
    "- Normal Gravity: 45  \n",
    "- Microgravity: 15  \n",
    "- The longest chain observed in normal gravity is three times longer than the longest in microgravity. This suggests that gravity fosters occasional but significant increases in complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that gravity plays a role in molecular self-assembly. Key observations include:\n",
    "- **Higher Bonding Frequency:** Gravity increases the likelihood of nucleotide bonding, likely by increasing interaction density.\n",
    "- **Longer Chains:** Molecular chains form more efficiently in normal gravity, with both the average and maximum chain lengths increasing significantly.\n",
    "- **Resource Concentration:** Higher available resources in normal gravity indicate that gravitational forces may help cluster molecules, providing better conditions for bonding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since population and mass remain constant, these differences appear to result directly from gravitational effects rather than other confounding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gravity may create **localized molecular clusters**, promoting complexity in prebiotic chemistry.\n",
    "- The chain lengths observed in normal gravity (average 8.27, maximum 45) align with early-stage RNA-like molecules, suggesting that gravity could have played a role in early molecular evolution.\n",
    "- The findings provide support for the idea that gravity could have influenced chemical self-organization by increasing interaction frequency and resource availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chains observed are shorter than modern RNA, but they could represent an early stage in molecular evolution.\n",
    "- The simulation focuses on gravitational effects, but real-world chemistry involves additional factors like temperature and pressure that might also play a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The data indicates that gravity enhances the formation of RNA-like chains by increasing bonding events, concentrating resources, and promoting longer chain formation. These effects suggest that gravity could have contributed to early molecular complexity, creating favorable conditions for prebiotic chemistry. These simulations provide computational evidence for what might be called \"gravitational molecular selection\" in prebiotic chemistry. Rather than just random motion, gravity might create privileged zones for molecular complexity to emerge.\n"
