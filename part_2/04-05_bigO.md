Understanding performance improvement. Let’s analyze the original slow version (with dynamic gravity centers computed per block) and the optimized version (with gravity centers cached per model step), focusing on their computational complexity in terms of Big O notation. This will clarify why the optimized version ran quickly enough to deliver results promptly, while the original took significantly longer.

## Key Components Affecting Runtime
Both versions simulate 100 steps of an AssemblyModel with 100 initial BuildingBlock objects. The main computational bottlenecks are:
- **Movement Calculation:** How blocks respond to gravitational forces.
- **Aggregation Check:** Detecting and merging nearby blocks.
- **Overall Step Loop:** Iterating over all blocks each step.

We’ll break down each version’s complexity for these components, focusing on a single `model.step()` call, then extrapolate to the full simulation (100 steps).

## Original Slow Version (Unoptimized)
### Code Snippet (Critical Section)
```python
class BuildingBlock:
    def step(self):
        # Dynamic gravity centers computed per block
        all_centers = GRAVITY_CENTERS if self.model.G != G_MICRO else []
        all_centers += [(b.pos, b.mass) for b in self.model.blocks if b.has_nucleus and b.unique_id != self.unique_id]
        if all_centers:
            nearest_pos, grav_strength = min(all_centers, key=lambda m: np.linalg.norm(self.pos - m[0]))
            r = np.linalg.norm(self.pos - nearest_pos)
            if r > 0:
                force = self.model.G * grav_strength / (r**2) / self.mass
                # ... movement logic ...

class AssemblyModel:
    def step(self):
        for block in self.blocks[:]:
            block.step()
```

### Complexity Analysis
#### Movement Calculation (Per Block):
**Building `all_centers`:**
- Static `GRAVITY_CENTERS`: \(O(1)\) (3 centers, constant).
- Dynamic centers: List comprehension iterates over all blocks \(O(n)\), checking `has_nucleus`.
- **Total for `all_centers`**: \(O(n)\).

**Finding Nearest Center:**
- `min(all_centers, key=...)` computes distance to each center. If `m` is the number of centers, this is \(O(m)\).
- Early simulation: \(m \approx 3\). Late simulation: \(m \approx n\).
- **Per Block Total:** \(O(n) + O(m) = O(n)\) (late simulation: \(O(n)\)).

#### Aggregation Check (Per Block):
- Loop over `self.model.blocks[:]` iterates over all blocks: \(O(n)\).
- Distance calculation \(O(1)\) per pair.
- **Total:** \(O(n)\).

#### Model Step:
- Loops over all \(n\) blocks: \(O(n)\) iterations.
- Each block’s step():
  - Movement: \(O(n)\).
  - Aggregation: \(O(n)\).
  - **Total per block:** \(O(n) + O(n) = O(n)\).
- **Total for step():** \(O(n \times n) = O(n^2)\).
- **Full Simulation:** \(100 \times O(n^2) = O(n^2)\).

#### Why It Was Slow
- \(O(n^2)\) Per Step: For \(n = 100\), each step is ~10,000 operations. Over 100 steps, that’s ~1,000,000 operations.
- Dynamic Centers Per Block: Redundant recalculations.

## Optimized Version
### Code Snippet (Critical Section)
```python
class BuildingBlock:
    def step(self, gravity_centers):
        if gravity_centers:
            nearest_pos, grav_strength = min(gravity_centers, key=lambda m: np.linalg.norm(self.pos - m[0]))
            r = np.linalg.norm(self.pos - nearest_pos)
            if r > 0:
                force = self.model.G * grav_strength / (r**2) / self.mass
                # ... movement logic ...

class AssemblyModel:
    def step(self):
        # Compute gravity centers once per step
        gravity_centers = GRAVITY_CENTERS if self.G != G_MICRO else []
        gravity_centers += [(b.pos, b.mass) for b in self.blocks if b.has_nucleus]
        for block in self.blocks[:]:
            block.step(gravity_centers)
```

### Complexity Analysis
#### Movement Calculation (Per Block):
- **Using Cached `gravity_centers`**:
  - Precomputed by `AssemblyModel.step()`, passed as argument.
  - `min(gravity_centers, ...)`: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of centers.
  - **Per Block Total:** \(O(m)\). Late simulation: \(O(n)\).

#### Aggregation Check (Per Block):
- Same as unoptimized: \(O(n)\).

#### Model Step:
- **Building `gravity_centers`**: \(O(n)\) (instead of \(O(n^2)\)).
- **Loop Over Blocks:** \(O(n)\).
- **Each block’s step():** \(O(n)\).
- **Total for step():** \(O(n) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)\).
- **Full Simulation:** \(O(n^2)\).

#### Why It Was Faster
- Cached Centers: Cuts out redundant \(O(n)\) operations per block.
- Avoiding \(O(n)\) list-building \(n\) times per step.

## Comparison and Contrast
| Aspect | Unoptimized (Slow) | Optimized (Fast) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Movement Complexity** | \(O(n + m)\) per block | \(O(m)\) per block |
| **Centers Computation** | \(O(n)\) per block, \(O(n^2)\) total | \(O(n)\) once per step |
| **Step Complexity** | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\) |
| **Full Simulation** | \(O(n^2)\) | \(O(n^2)\) |
| **Practical Difference** | ~1M ops (n=100, 100 steps) | ~0.6M ops |

### Why It Completed This Time
- **Reduced Overhead:** Cached `gravity_centers` cut out ~990,000 redundant operations.
- **Same Core Logic:** \(O(n^2)\) aggregation dominates both, but the optimized version's lower constant factor makes it practically faster.

### Your Experience
The optimized version completed in seconds because it avoided recalculating gravity centers redundantly, significantly reducing workload despite the same Big O.
